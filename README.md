# Pika Wifi üéØ

## Basic Details
### Team Name: Strawhats
### Team Members
- Team Lead: Gowrishankar S Menon - Cochin University of Science and Technology
- Member 2: Ebin Amson - Cochin University of Science and Technology

### Project Description
Pika Wifi is a useless-but-delightful desktop application that gamifies your Wi-Fi experience. It provides motivational quotes whose intensity is inversely proportional to your signal strength, maps your connection history, and features an interactive Pikachu, all while running silently in the background.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
What if you're in a bad network area and you don't feel like hustling? What if you need a quote to lift your spirits when your bars drop? Productivity plummets when the Wi-Fi bars drop, and there's no cute electric mouse to cheer us on. Who will motivate us in these dark, low-signal times?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We read your signal strength, match it with a perfectly motivational quote, and track where you had this spiritual awakening. All plotted live on a map with your IP-based location history. Because nothing says "productivity" like a Pikachu telling you to believe in yourself when your internet is terrible. You're welcome.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
**For Software:**
- **Languages used:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Frameworks used:** Electron.js
- **Libraries used:** Node.js, Leaflet.js, axios
- **Tools used:** npm, electron-builder, VS Code

**For Hardware:**
- A computer with a Wi-Fi card (obviously)
- A mouse (for clicking Pikachu)
- Speakers (to hear the glorious pika sounds)
- Internet connection (ironically needed to mock your bad connection)

### Implementation
**For Software:**
```bash
# Installation
# Download (Recommended)
Download the executable installer: [Pika Wifi Setup 1.0.0.exe](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/137EiCXeO1HPJyjuNOaPSheLp9zxXSO1-?usp=sharing)

# Development Setup
git clone https://github.com/GowrishankarSMenon/pika-wifi.git
cd pika-wifi
npm install

# Run from Source
npm start

## üß™ Testing & Simulation
While running the app from the source (`npm start`), you can use the following keyboard shortcuts to simulate different conditions:

**Wi-Fi Simulation:**
* `1`: Simulates a **Weak** Wi-Fi signal (20%).
* `2`: Simulates a **Medium** Wi-Fi signal (50%).
* `3`: Simulates a **Strong** Wi-Fi signal (90%).
* `0`: Resets to your **real** Wi-Fi signal.

**Location Simulation:**
* `4`: Simulates your location as **Tokyo** üóº.
* `5`: Simulates your location as **New York** üóΩ.
* `6`: Simulates your location as **London** üé°.
* `9`: Resets to your **real** IP-based location.
* `L`: Manually triggers the "Log Location" action.
```
